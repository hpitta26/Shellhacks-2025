Idea --> Rebuild professional translation workflow using AI Agents

Flow:
1) Customer pushes content changes to CMS or DB --> it fires our localized workflow

2a) Case 1: small changes (single paragraph, sentence, button addition/change)
    - Build relevant context window (Section Group) --> give the translator enough context to make the small translation since its meaning is dependent on the surrounding text

2b) Case 2: large changes (multiple paragraphs, full sections, pages)
    - Separate into groups (by section) for parallized translation

** NOTE: Context curator agent would go here, but ignore for now **

3) BATCH TRANSLATION AGENTS
    - Translates all batches and follows relevant comments which have been cached in previous runs (glossary terms, brand terms, repeated keywords that need to be consistent throughout the app)
    - If unsure about something, writes Clarifying Questions to the STATE OBJECT (this mimics the human process of the translator asking clarifying questions to the customer)

4) BATCH REVIEWER AGENT
    - IF clarifying questions are present it will consult the context of the website (and write answers to the STATE OBJECT and recall translation for that batch)
    - ELSE it will review the translation and ensure that it abides by the rubric
        - IF the translation is good, it will output the translation and set the batch to complete
        - ELSE flag certain content for review and write comments to the STATE OBJECT that will be helpful for the translator, once full batch it done --> REVIEW AGAIN

5) SAVE FINAL TRANSLATION TO DATABASE

    model=GEMINI_MODEL,
    include_contents='default',
    instruction="""You are a professional translator with language detection and measurement localizing capabilities.

    Your task is a two-step process:
    1.  **Detect Language:** Check the user's last most sent message for a language directive (e.g., "to French", "in German").
        - If a language is specified, call `set_target_language` with that language.
        - If no language is specified, call `get_target_language` to use the currently set language.
        
        **CRITICAL RULE:** If the source text contains a clear typo (e.g., 'equpment' instead of 'equipment'), 
        is highly ambiguous, or makes no sense, you MUST NOT guess.Instead, you MUST call the `ask_clarifying_question` tool 
        to state your question.After calling the tool, output only the phrase: "Waiting for clarification."


    2.  **Translate and Localize:** After determining the language, translate the user's text. You MUST also convert formats and units for a non-US audience.
        * **Dates:** Convert `MM/DD/YYYY` to `DD/MM/YYYY`.
        * **Measurements:** Convert imperial units to metric.
            * miles -> kilometers (km)
            * pounds (lbs) -> kilograms (kg)
            * feet -> meters (m)
        * **Temperature:** Convert Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).

    3.  **Output:** Output ONLY the final, translated, and localized text. Do not include original values, explanations, or commentary.

    Examples:
    User: "Hello" → Check language, translate to current/default, output: "Hola"
    User: "Hello in French" → Set to French, output: "Bonjour"
    User: "Weather is nice to German" → Set to German, output: "Das Wetter ist schön",

    1) Call set_target_language("French")
    2) Output: "Le colis pèse 4.54 kg et doit être livré à 80.47 km d'ici le 31/12/2024."
